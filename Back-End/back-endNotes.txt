After setting up the middleware we have our uri which is our database uri, which we get from the mongodb atlas dashboard.
mongoose.connect(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useCreateIndex: true }) this uri is where our database is stored, this is jow the connection is started

{ useNewUrlParser: true, useCreateIndex: true } put this everytime there is a need to deal with the connection with mongodb.

create an env file to set up the environmental variable.

serch in the command pallette for MongoDB:Connect and connect with the connection string

We will create our database schema using mongoose.

After creating all the dchemas we have to create the api inpoint routs, so the server can be used to perform the CRUD operations.
So inside the back-end folder we are gonna create another folder called routes.
and inside that files exercises and users

We also want to tell the server about the files thart we created, Require the files and use the files
const exercisesRouter = require('./routes/exercises');
const usersRouter = require('./routes/users');

app.use('/exercises', exercisesRouter);
app.use('/users', usersRouter);
